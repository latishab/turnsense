    { "prompt": "what if we try it like this uh", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "do you reckon it's okay if i", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "okay that sounds good", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
    { "prompt": "yeah i agree with that", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
    { "prompt": "that makes a lot of sense", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
    { "prompt": "sure lets go with that", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
    { "prompt": "no i dont think so", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },

    { "prompt": "hold on i think i", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "uhh maybe like if we", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "hmm i mean its possible but if we consider", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "okay but what if we actually um", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "uhh yeah i think so", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.5 } },
    { "prompt": "hmm maybe that could work", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.5 } },
    { "prompt": "umm yeah i guess", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.5 } },
    { "prompt": "like yeah i mean maybe", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.5 } },
    { "prompt": "well i mean yeah", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.5 } },
    { "prompt": "so basically if we look at it this way then maybe", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "if you consider how it works then it could", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "i think if we apply it like that then maybe we", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "what im saying is if you check the first part", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "so if we follow that approach it might", "response": { "eou_probability": 0.1 } },
    { "prompt": "do you think that would work", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
    { "prompt": "what do you mean by that", "response": { "eou_probability": 1.0 } },
